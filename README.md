# GasPrice_ARIMA
In febreaury 2020 Texas has an historic energy outage due unusual low tempertures. In this event gas and electricity prices go extraordinarily high, affecting energy prices in Mexico as well. In this repository use forecast library to avoid the outlier effect of Texas outage event, so I can use an ARIMA model for Gas prices index of Waha and HoustonShipChannel.

Vizualization are showed in this repository as well.
